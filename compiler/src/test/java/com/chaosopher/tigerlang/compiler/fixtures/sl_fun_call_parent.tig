/*
Example of static link usage.
main calls aa, passes main.fp as static link
aa calls dd, same level as dd, it passes aa.static_link as static link
dd uses x, which is defined in mains frame, 
Therefore we need to ensure that dd has static link that is a pointer
to main.fp

sl arg passed to dd from aa
aa expects frame pointer address for main
get aa's static link mem(a.fp - 8) : address of aa's parent frame
