/*
In this example bb calls dd which is at a lower level.
We need to calculate the differnce in depth between bb
and dd, it is 1. 

bb static link points to aa.fp, aa static link points to main.fp

We should pass aa static link to dd.

mem(mem(bb.fp - 8) - 8)

//bb.sl, aa.sl

We pass this to dd as its static link, or pointer to dd's 
parent frame pointer.
